# algorithm
a lightweight project that provides alogrithm solution I ever met and simple test for this project

## It's novelty
 1.support camke and IDE(clion) \
 2.easy to understand solutions and mostly optimal both in time complexity and space complexity\
 3.simple test for every algrithm to quick judge its correctness by yourself
 
 ## How to complie
 Go to the root directory of algorithm and make
 ```
cd algorithm
make
```

## How to use
This project divides the problems accosicated with different types and its unique index, like hash、dc、list and etc.You can see clearly in directory *problem*. 

```
>>cat problem/leetcode.txt
index   type        name
1       hash        two-sum
2       list        add-two-numbers
.....
.....
.....
```
Then simply test your algorithm, like
```
./main leecode 1    //represent problems in leetcode and the its index
```
## What to do
more works for learning and solving algorithms
